# üñºÔ∏è Direct Image Download Instructions

Since I can see your images are hosted on your Wix site, here's the most direct way to get them:

## Method 1: Browser Inspector (2 minutes)

1. **Open your site**: Go to https://www.equation-hi-lo.com/
2. **Right-click on the game image** ‚Üí Select "Inspect Element"
3. **In the developer panel**, look for the `<img>` tag
4. **Copy the src URL** (it will look like: `https://static.wixstatic.com/media/abc123_def456.png`)
5. **Paste that URL in a new tab**
6. **Right-click ‚Üí Save image as** ‚Üí `game-screenshot.png`

## Method 2: Direct URLs (If you can see them)

If you can see the image URLs in your browser's developer tools, here are the typical Wix URL patterns:
- Game screenshot: Usually contains "Screenshot" or the filename you uploaded
- Logo: Usually contains "logo" or "hayzgames" in the URL

## Method 3: I'll Help You Extract Them

**Alternative approach**: 
1. **Take screenshots** of your current Wix site
2. **Crop and save** them as:
   - `images/game-screenshot.png` (the main board game photo)
   - `images/hayzgames-logo.png` (your company logo)

This is perfectly fine for a website - many sites use this approach!

## Quick Test Instructions:

After you get the images:

```bash
# Put them in the images folder
cp /path/to/your/game-screenshot.png ./images/
cp /path/to/your/hayzgames-logo.png ./images/

# Commit and push
git add images/
git commit -m "Add website images"
git push origin main
```

## üìß Alternative: Send Me the URLs

If you can find the image URLs by inspecting your site, you can share them with me and I can help you download them with a script!
